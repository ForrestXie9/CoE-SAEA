The function should balance exploration and exploitation by considering the average performance of each action (calculated as the mean of its historical scores) while incorporating a mechanism for exploration, such as epsilon-greedy or softmax. Inputs include `score_set` (a dictionary of action indices with corresponding lists of scores), `total_selection_count` (the overall number of selections so far), `current_time_slot`, and `total_time_slots`. The output must be the index of the chosen action, encouraging diversity in selections especially early on to gather more data, while favoring higher-performing actions as more data is collected. Aim for a clear and efficient algorithm that enhances the selection strategy over time."

The function should begin by calculating the average historical scores for each action based on `score_set`. Implement a sophisticated exploration strategy, such as a dynamic \u03b5-greedy method or a contextual bandit approach, that adapts the exploration rate based on the current time slot and total selections, ensuring that actions with fewer historical selections receive a higher chance of being chosen. The function must return an `action_index` (an integer between 0 and 7) that maximizes the expected reward while promoting a diverse exploration of actions throughout the available time slots. Ensure the design is efficient and responsive to changing conditions in the selection landscape.\n"
