The function should utilize the `score_set` dictionary to gauge historical performance of each action by analyzing the average score of previously selected actions. Incorporate the `total_selection_count` to facilitate exploration by amplifying the selection probabilities for less frequently chosen actions. Use the `current_time_slot` and `total_time_slots` to adjust the exploration rate dynamically, enabling a gradual shift towards exploitation as time progresses. The output must be a single integer that corresponds to the index of the selected action, ensuring it lies between 0 and 7. Prioritize actions with higher average scores, but maintain a mechanism for exploring alternatives to find potentially better-performing actions."
