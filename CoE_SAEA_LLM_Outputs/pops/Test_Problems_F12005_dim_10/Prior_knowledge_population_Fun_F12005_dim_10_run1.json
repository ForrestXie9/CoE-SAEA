               "  \nDesign a sophisticated action selection function that dynamically balances the exploration of lesser-chosen actions with the exploitation of those that have demonstrated strong past performance. This function should operate within a framework of eight unique actions, represented by indices ranging from 0 to 7.  \n\n**Input Parameters:**  \n- `score_set` (dict): A dictionary where keys are action indices (0-7) and values are lists of floats (0 to 1), representing historical scores for each action. The length of each list indicates how many times the corresponding action has been selected.  \n- `total_selection_count` (int): The total number of selections made across all actions, providing context for potential selection biases.  \n- `current_time_slot` (int): The index of the current time slot, allowing for the identification of temporal trends in action performance.  \n- `total_time_slots` (int): The total number of time slots available for action selection, influencing the exploration-exploitation balance based on the progression of time.  \n\n**Output Requirement:**  \nThe function must return a single integer corresponding to the selected action index, constrained within the range of 0 to 7.  \n\n**Function Design Guidelines:**  \n1. Calculate the mean score for each action from the `score_set` to establish a foundational performance metric.  \n2. Implement an adaptive strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation, such as epsilon-greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), or Thompson Sampling. This strategy should leverage the number of times each action has been selected and the total selection count, enabling responsiveness to fluctuations in performance data.  \n3. Ensure that the function promotes diversity in action selection while maximizing cumulative rewards over the selection period. Incorporate time-sensitive adjustments to enhance exploration during earlier slots and gradually shift towards exploitation as time progresses.  \n\nYour design should focus on efficiency, adaptability, and robustness to effectively manage varied operational demands throughout the specified time slots.  \n"
